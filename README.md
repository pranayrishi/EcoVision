## Inspiration
The inspiration for CleanTogether stemmed from witnessing the growing environmental challenges our planet faces, particularly littering, improper waste disposal, and deforestation. We envisioned a platform that not only empowers individuals to take action but also harnesses the power of AI to promote sustainable practices. By uniting communities and leveraging technology, we aimed to create a meaningful impact on our environment.

## What it does
CleanTogether is an AI-powered application designed to combat littering and promote sustainable waste disposal. Users can capture images of littering and environmental events, organize and participate in community cleanups, and utilize AI-driven guidance for proper recycling. Additionally, the app provides educational videos on deforestation, raising awareness and fostering a deeper understanding of environmental issues.

## How we built it
We built CleanTogether using a combination of advanced technologies and user-centric design principles:
- **Front-End Development**: Leveraged React Native to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a seamless user experience on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Back-End Development**: Utilized Python and TensorFlow to develop robust AI models capable of detecting and categorizing waste.
- **Cloud Integration**: Implemented cloud services for efficient data storage, processing, and real-time updates.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Embedded educational video content to enrich the user experience and provide valuable information on deforestation.

## Challenges we ran into
- **AI Model Accuracy**: Developing AI models that accurately identify and categorize various types of waste was challenging. We iterated extensively to achieve high precision and reliability.
- **User Accessibility**: Ensuring the app is intuitive and accessible for all age groups required thorough testing and refinement of the user interface.
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Coordinating real-time updates and notifications for community cleanups necessitated robust back-end infrastructure and efficient data handling.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrating multimedia content and ensuring smooth functionality across different devices posed technical challenges that we successfully overcame.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **AI-Powered Recycling Guidance**: Successfully implementing an AI system that guides users in proper waste disposal and recycling.
- **Community Engagement**: Building a platform that fosters community involvement and environmental stewardship, encouraging collective action.
- **Educational Content**: Creating and integrating engaging educational videos on deforestation, enriching users' knowledge and awareness.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Developing an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances user experience and engagement.

## What we learned
Throughout this journey, we learned the critical role of community engagement in driving environmental change and the immense potential of AI in facilitating sustainable practices. Our team gained valuable insights into mobile app development, AI integration, and the importance of creating user-centric solutions. We also recognized the need for continuous improvement and adaptability in addressing environmental challenges.

## What's next for CleanTogether
Looking ahead, we plan to enhance CleanTogether with new features such as predictive analytics for identifying future littering hotspots and augmented reality guidance for cleanups. We aim to establish partnerships with local organizations to amplify our impact and continuously update our educational content to keep users informed and engaged. Our vision is to create a global community dedicated to environmental sustainability through innovative technology and collective action.
